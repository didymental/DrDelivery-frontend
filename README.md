# DrDelivery

## Introduction
It is well known that last-mile delivery often constitutes the most expensive portion of shipping and can consist of up to 53% of total shipping costs, according to a [McKinsey report](https://www.businessinsider.com/last-mile-delivery-shipping-explained). Furthermore, small-parcel delivery can feel expensive given that delivery fees are fixed, or even charged at a higher price. For instance, Grab, a regional super-app well known for its food delivery services, charges an additional small-order fee. Replacing the most expensive portion of delivery, the human, with automated drones is one way to reduce the cost of last-mile delivery. 

However, the potential of drones in delivery has yet to be fully implemented. We believe that we can uncover meaningful value in utilizing drones for delivery purposes. To a price-sensitive customer, a proposition of value is the lower marginal and unit costs of delivery operations. In addition to price, we believe that a drone network system can provide to the customer a centralised, non-fragmented view of multiple concurrent orders, improving the customer journey and experience with delivery. 

We wish to explore the feasibility of such a system by first creating the customer-facing management software that such a network will require. This customer facing management software is DrDelivery.
